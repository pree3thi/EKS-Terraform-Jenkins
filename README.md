# EKS-Terraform-Jenkins
To Set Up EKS Cluster Using Terraform and Jenkins

# Jenkins and Terraform:

**Jenkins:** Open-source automation server to automate various aspects of software development, including building, testing, and deploying code. It enables continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) by allowing developers to integrate changes to the project and deliver the updated code to production continuously and automatically.

**Terraform:** Open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). With Terraform, users can create, manage, and update resources such as virtual machines, networks, and storage across multiple cloud providers and services.

By integrating Jenkins and Terraform, organizations can achieve a high level of automation and consistency in their software development and operations processes, leading to faster delivery times, reduced errors, and more reliable infrastructure.

**Jenkins + Terraform:**
1.	Infrastructure Provisioning: Jenkins can trigger Terraform scripts to provision or update infrastructure as part of the build or deployment process. This ensures that the infrastructure is consistent and repeatable across environments.
2.	Automated Deployments: After a successful build, Jenkins can use Terraform to deploy applications to the cloud or on-premises infrastructure. This includes creating or updating resources such as virtual machines, networks, and databases.
3.	Environment Management: Jenkins can manage different environments (development, testing, production) by running Terraform scripts that configure each environment according to predefined specifications.
4.	Version Control: Both Jenkins and Terraform configurations can be stored in version control systems (e.g., Git). Jenkins can automatically apply changes when updates are pushed to the repository, ensuring that both application code and infrastructure configurations are versioned and auditable.
5.	Orchestration: Jenkins can orchestrate complex workflows involving multiple steps, such as running tests, deploying applications, and provisioning infrastructure using Terraform. This ensures that each step is executed in the correct order and that dependencies are properly managed.
